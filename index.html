                Welcome to Outdoor Adventures. Its summer time and we all get tired of the city life and feel like indulging in things such  as hiking, climbing, fishing, canoeing, hunting and camping. We offer all of these activities and we hope to help you make the best of your summer
            </p>

            <!-- THIS SECTIONS IS FOR THE HIKING ACTIVITIES AND INFORMATIONS -->

            <h2 class="heading-1">Hiking</h2>

                    <p class="slide">Lions Head</p>
                </div>
                <p>The distinct slope next to Table Mountain known as Lion’s Head offers magnificent views of the city, Table Bay and the Atlantic         Ocean, making it a top spot for Instagrammers.
                    Starting and ending point Signal Hill Road, at the base of the Forestry Road.
                    Duration 2 – 3 hours
                    Need to know You will have to do some climbing, however there are handholds and chains to assist you. If, like me, you’d prefer to avoid the climbing, a roundabout route (that’s still quite steep) adds half an hour to your hike.
                </p>

                    <p class="slide">Platteklip Gorge</p>
                </div>
                <p>Probably the second most well-known hiking trail in Cape Town (after Lion’s Head), Platteklip is not so easygoing, despite its      popularity. Sure, there’s not much climbing or scrambling involved, but there’s a lot of upward walking, which probably makes      it the ideal route for a workout. It provides a direct route to the summit of Table Mountain, for those who think taking the       cable car is for lightweights.
                    Starting point Tafelberg Road
                    End point Upper Cableway Station
                    Duration 3 hours, though some ridiculously fit people have been known to run up the trail in an hour.
                    Need to know Platteklip is best avoided on a hot day, as there is little shade to be found along the trail.
                    Be prepared for all types of weather, and bring a hat, sunblock and jacket.

                <p>Visitors from all over the world flock to Mpumalanga which offers some of the best rock climbing in the world and contains the         famed Waterval Boven Mountain. This exquisite area also offers The Restaurant which has more than 500 routes and there are still       numerous untouched rock faces in the area that are yet to be explored.

                <p>Rock climbing is a firm favourite amongst outdoor enthusiasts as it boasts the splendour of the natural environ while making little or     no negative impact on the land, water or air. Montagu, in the Western Cape, is a particularly popular mountain climbing spot as it is      very rocky (an obvious key ingredient), accessible and just plain pretty.

                    <p class="slide">Lions Head</p>
                </div>
                <p>The scenery is breathtaking as the mountains tower over you, and the lush green nature reserve stretches as far as the eye can see. The     smell of fynbos surrounds the river, as insects buzz and the sound of wildlife echoes off the gorges.
                    Tubing is provided during the summer months, while rafting is done during winter. Professional guides lead you on this adventurous ride of a life time, but bookings are essential. Relax and for a few hours forget about the hustle and bustle of the city.
                    The trip is 2 -3 hours long, depending on the flow of the river. SA Forest does a 4km stretch which consists of 10 rapids.
                    The Palmiet river is a very high Intensity river compare to other rivers in SA, as there is very little flat water to paddle but lots of white water and long rolling rapids. If you are an adrenaline junkie, this is definitely the activity for you.

                <p>Keurbooms River Nature Reserve, a World Heritage Site, is an exquisite, small reserve of just 740 hectares located in the lush Garden      Route region just outside Plettenberg Bay. The Keurbooms River passes through the reserve bringing an abundance of water from further      up in the Tsitsikamma Mountains to enter the ocean through the stunning estuary. Promising an undiluted nature experience of indigenous    forests, unspoilt river gorge, and protected kloofs, this reserve is a favourite destination for both local and international              travellers.
