                Welcome to Outdoor Adventures. Its summer time and we all get tired of the city life and feel like indulging in things such  as hiking, climbing, fishing, canoeing, hunting and camping. We offer all of these activities and we hope to help you make the best of your summer

                    <p>Lions Head</p>
                </div>
                <p>The distinct slope next to Table Mountain known as Lion’s Head offers magnificent views of the city, Table Bay and the Atlantic Ocean,      making it a top spot for Instagrammers.
                    Starting and ending point Signal Hill Road, at the base of the Forestry Road.
                    Duration 2 – 3 hours
                    Need to know You will have to do some climbing, however there are handholds and chains to assist you. If, like me, you’d prefer to avoid the climbing, a roundabout route (that’s still quite steep) adds half an hour to your hike.
                    Good to know The Lion’s Head hiking trail is currently closed for maintenance, and is expected to reopen on 16 February 2019.
                    Child-friendly? Yes, although they’ll probably want to avoid the climbing chains (and rock scrambling near the end of the trail)
                    Dog-friendly? No

                        <p>Platteklip Gorge</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Probably the second most well-known hiking trail in Cape Town (after Lion’s Head), Platteklip is not so easygoing, despite its          popularity. Sure, there’s not much climbing or scrambling involved, but there’s a lot of upward walking, which probably makes it       the ideal route for a workout. It provides a direct route to the summit of Table Mountain, for those who think taking the cable        car is for lightweights.
                        Starting point Tafelberg Road
                        End point Upper Cableway Station
                        Duration 3 hours, though some ridiculously fit people have been known to run up the trail in an hour.
                        Need to know Platteklip is best avoided on a hot day, as there is little shade to be found along the trail.
                        Be prepared for all types of weather, and bring a hat, sunblock and jacket.
                        Proper hiking shoes are required; do not attempt this trail with slip-slops.
                        If you plan to take the cable car down, make note of operational times and ensure you reach the station before the last cable car leaves.
                        Important note SANParks has informed us that many rescues are performed at this site, as people underestimate the heat and the level of fitness required, or they miss the last cable car and end up stranded on the mountain at night. Please take the necessary precautions.
                        Child-friendly? Yes, although take note of the above.
                        Dog-friendly? Bringing dogs is not recommended on this trail, as they struggle in the heat.
